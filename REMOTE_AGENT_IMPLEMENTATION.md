# Remote Agent Implementation Guide

## Overview
This document details the technical requirements and implementation strategy for adding remote agent functionality to the Augment Neovim plugin, similar to VS Code Remote Development.

## Architecture Components

### 🏗️ Core Components

#### 1. Remote Agent Server
- **Purpose**: Lightweight daemon process running on target machines
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Handle file operations and code execution
  - Manage Augment API communication
  - Maintain local workspace context and file watching
  - Provide secure API endpoints for client communication

#### 2. Local Client Integration
- **Purpose**: Extends existing `m_augment` plugin with remote capabilities
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Manage multiple remote connections simultaneously
  - Provide transparent file editing experience (feels local)
  - Handle connection state and automatic reconnection
  - Integrate with existing chat and code injection features

#### 3. Communication Protocol
- **Purpose**: Secure, efficient communication between client and server
- **Features**:
  - WebSocket or gRPC-based communication
  - Message types: file operations, code execution, Augment requests
  - Compression and efficient binary transfer for large files
  - Authentication and encryption (SSH keys, tokens, certificates)

## Technical Implementation Layers

### 🔗 Transport Layer
```
Components:
├── WebSocket/gRPC for real-time bidirectional communication
